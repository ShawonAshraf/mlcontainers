# mlcontainers

A collection of devcontainer configurations I usually use for my deep learning / machine learning projects.

## usage

Install the `devcontainer-cli` via `npm`

```bash
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
```

Then run the configuration you want by

```bash
devcontainer up --workspace-folder <path-to-configuration>
```
